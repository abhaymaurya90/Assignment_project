# License Management and Validation System

## System Requirements Specification

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of a robust License Management and Validation System for Software as a Service (SAAS). The system is designed to ensure secure and centralized license validation for all clients, enhancing the control and security of software licenses.

#### 1.2 Scope
This system will be integrated into all SAAS products delivered to clients. It will perform license validation by connecting to a central server, ensuring the licenses are active and legitimate.

#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **SAAS**: Software as a Service
- **LMS**: License Management System

### 2. System Overview

#### 2.1 System Description
The License Management and Validation System will be responsible for validating the authenticity and status of licenses across all SAAS products delivered to clients. The system will employ strong security measures to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

#### 2.2 System Architecture
The proposed architecture is inspired by Microsoft's Software Architectural principles and consists of the following components:

##### 2.2.1 Client-Side Component
- **License Validator**:
  - Embed this component into every SAAS product delivered to clients.
  - Responsible for communicating with the central server to validate the license.
  - Securely store license information locally to minimize unnecessary communication.

##### 2.2.2 Central Server Component
- **License Management Server**:
  - Hosted on a highly secure cloud infrastructure.
  - Handles incoming license validation requests from clients.
  - Manages the central database of valid licenses.
  - Utilizes a secure communication protocol (e.g., HTTPS) for data transmission.

- **Database**:
  - Stores encrypted license data.
  - Implements backup and recovery mechanisms.

##### 2.2.3 Administrative Interface
- **Web-based Dashboard**:
  - Allows administrators to manage licenses, view usage statistics, and generate reports.
  - Implements role-based access control for administrators.

### How to Use

1. **Client Integration**: 
   - Embed the License Validator into your SAAS product.
   - Ensure the license is validated on the central server during the application's initialization.

2. **Administrator Access**:
   - Use the Web-based Dashboard for license management and monitoring.
   - Access to the dashboard is restricted based on roles.

### System Requirements

- **Server Requirements**: 
  - Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, etc.).
  - Secure storage for license data (encrypted).

- **Client Requirements**:
  - Embed the license validator component in SAAS products.
  - HTTPS for secure data transmission.
